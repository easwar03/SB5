His influence on the game, both tactically and technically, has left an indelible mark, making him a true legend of the sport.</p>

        <p>Andrea Pirlo's exceptional skill, vision, and composure on the ball make him a strong contender for the title of the greatest midfielder ever. His elegance and smoothness at all aspects of the game cannot be overstated. </p>
	<p>Unfazed by pressure, he famously spent the day of the 2006 World Cup final sleeping and playing PlayStation before going on to win the tournament that evening. Pirlo epitomized greatness with a coolness that was unmatched.</p>
        
	<h3> 3. Andres Iniesta </h3>
        <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt26dfa12dc5957db7/60dd514b892a730f5889a764/b036ae61fe355ce2e9374e9c44d97056320e6ce7.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200&quality=60" alt="de Iniesta">
        <p>Andres Iniesta exemplifies a blend of elegance and reliability, extremely gifted with exceptional vision, wonderful control, and beautiful dribbling. </p>
	<p>Iniesta played a crucial role in securing two treble victories with Barcelona and Spain's historic three consecutive major tournament triumphs. He is one of the few players ever to score and be Man Of The Match in both UCL and World Cup finals.</p>

        <p>A diminutive midfielder, he is best known for his excellent vision, being able to change the course of the game with deft pass. He is also able to play with both feet and combines with his swift, offensive positioning off-the-ball. He is a central creative midfielder  who set tempo of the game as master of "pre-assists" sometimes adopt as a defensive midfielder tracking back to win the ball.</p>
	<p>He won 5 UCLs with Real Madrid and also won the Ballon D'or in 2018 for reaching the FIFA World Cup final the same year.</p>
    	
	<h3> 5. David Silva </h3>

        <p>David Silva's claim to being the greatest ever midfielder ever stems from his elegant and technical skills, intelligent playmaking, and consistent excellence over a decade at Manchester City. While more common in the Spanish and Italian leagues, such masterful technique is unheard of in the English Premier League, known for its fast and physical nature. Furthermore, he has been remarkable for Real Sociedad to this day even at an advanced age.</p>
	<p>Silva's ability to dictate the tempo, his impeccable vision, and his knack for providing key assists made him a driving force behind City's multiple title-winning campaigns, including their historic centurion season. He has won the FIFA World Cup with Spain as well, being their fourth highest ever scorer and second highest ever assist provider.</p>
